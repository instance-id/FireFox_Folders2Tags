#FireFox_Folders2Tags  

An application that takes in the path to a Firefox 'bookmarks-YYYY-MM-DD.json' backup file as a parameter and then based on your bookmark folder structure, applies tags to your bookmarks based on the parent folder names,

Example folder structure => Tags applied to the bookmarks  

```
 Bookmark_Toolbar
     \ Work   
          \ Server 
              \ Web
                  \ Website Login : thewebserver.com   | Tags:[Work,Server,Web]
              \ Email 
                  \ Email Login : theemailserver.com   | Tags:[Work,Server,Email]
      | Dev
          \ dotnet
              \ C# Corner : c-sharpcorner.com          | Tags:[Dev,dotnet]
              | .NET Blog : devblogs.microsoft.com     | Tags:[Dev,dotnet]
          | Go   
              \ GoLang : golangnews.com                | Tags:[Dev,Go]
```

## Usage
First and most important, backup your current bookmarks file. I recommend you take the exported bookmarks json file, make a copy and store that somewhere safe and leave it there just in case. You never know if you might need it one day.

Once you have a backup bookmarks-YYYY-MM-DD.json file, either move it into the same folder as FireFox_Folders2Tags.exe and it will find it automatically, or run from the commandline passing in the path of the file:
```powershell
.\FireFox_Folders2Tags.exe "C:\myfiles\bookmarks-2020-12-20.json"
```
Once complete, a new json file will be created with the same name as your input file, but will have .tags added after the date.  

Ex: 
```powershell
Input-File  = bookmarks-2020-12-20.json
Output-File = bookmarks-2020-12-20.tag.json
```

#### Warning: The following restoration step removes all of your current bookmarks and reimports them from the file. This is why it is very important to make sure you keep a copy of your original backup file somewhere safe. 

---
You can then go back to FireFox and select Restore > Choose File as seen below. Then you select the new bookmarks-**.tags.json

## Notes:

| Note | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| Version | I have tested this in the FireFox Developer version of the browser: version 85.0b3 (64-bit). I cannot say whether it will work on other build types or versions. |
| Blank Folders | I was using a folder on my bookmark bar which has no name, but when I went to reimport it, it was still there, but had no contents. |
| Capacity | This was the max tested, as it is how many bookmarks I had. ![](https://i.imgur.com/KHupJqS.png)  |
